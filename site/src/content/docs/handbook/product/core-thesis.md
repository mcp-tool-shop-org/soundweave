## High-Quality Original Music for Games

Soundweave exists to produce music that is genuinely good -- not placeholder, not algorithmically adequate, but composed and performed with real musical intent. Every feature in the product serves this goal. If a feature makes it easier to ship mediocre music, it does not belong.

The measure of success is not "does the music change when the game state changes" but "does the music sound like it was composed by someone who cares." Adaptive music should not be an excuse for lower quality -- it should be a vehicle for higher quality, because the music responds to what the player is experiencing.

## Adaptive Scoring as a First-Class Authoring Model

Adaptive music is not a bolt-on. In Soundweave, adaptation is part of the authoring model from the start:

- **Scenes** are musical states that respond to game context, built from layered stems with gain, muting, and section roles
- **Trigger bindings** map runtime state to scenes with deterministic priority resolution -- highest priority wins, pack order breaks ties
- **Transitions** define exactly how music moves between states using five modes: `immediate`, `crossfade`, `bar-sync`, `stinger-then-switch`, and `cooldown-fade`
- **Cue families** group related musical ideas across game contexts by role (exploration, combat, boss, stealth, recovery, tension, victory, mystery)
- **Score profiles** define the sonic identity of regions, factions, and encounters with tempo ranges, intensity ranges, key/scale, and palette tags
- **Motif families** carry thematic material across the entire score, linking variants to scenes

Every one of these is authored -- not inferred, not generated, not random. The creator makes deliberate musical decisions, and the adaptive system executes them faithfully at runtime.

## Why Composition, Playback, and Runtime Logic All Matter

A soundtrack pack that only describes playback rules is incomplete. A pack that only contains audio is inflexible. Soundweave's data model includes four layers, all first-class:

- **Composition data** -- clips with notes (pitch, velocity, start tick, duration), lanes, variants, instruments, scales, chords, motif transforms, and cue structures with timelines and section roles
- **Playback structure** -- scenes with stem layers, clip layers with intensity tiers and section roles, gain control, and mute/solo settings
- **Runtime logic** -- trigger bindings with conditions and operators, transitions with mode and duration, deterministic scene resolution
- **Creative metadata** -- templates, snapshots, branches (with lineage tracking), favorites, collections, and field-by-field compare

This layering is what makes Soundweave a workstation rather than a file organizer. Composition informs playback. Playback implements runtime logic. Creative metadata enables safe iteration across all three.

## The Export Boundary

The authoring pack (`SoundtrackPack`) holds everything. The runtime pack holds only what a game engine needs: scenes, bindings, transitions, stems, and asset references. This clean boundary means:

- Authoring complexity does not leak into the game runtime
- The runtime contract is small enough that any engine can implement it
- Creative data (snapshots, branches, automation captures) stays private to the authoring workflow
- Exported packs are deterministically serialized for version control

## Creative Power as the Measure

Each major phase of Soundweave's development is measured by how much creative power it gives the user. Not by feature count, not by API surface, not by buzzword compliance. The question is always: can the creator do something musically meaningful that they could not do before?
