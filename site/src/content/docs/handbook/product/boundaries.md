Soundweave has clear boundaries. Understanding what it does not do is as important as understanding what it does, because those boundaries are what keep the product focused and effective.

## Not a General-Purpose DAW Replacement

Soundweave does not aim to replace Ableton, Logic, Reaper, or any full DAW. It does not do waveform editing, plugin/VST hosting, mastering chains, or multi-take recording. It assumes you bring finished audio assets or use its built-in instruments and sample workflow to create playable sources. The DAW stays in your chain -- Soundweave picks up where the DAW leaves off.

If you need to record a live guitar take, apply a chain of VST effects, or master a final mix, use a DAW. Soundweave consumes the output of that process as audio assets and builds adaptive game scores from them.

## Not a Metadata-Only Soundtrack Planner

Soundweave is not a spreadsheet for organizing music files. It actively composes, arranges, and structures music. Clips have notes with pitch, velocity, and timing. Cues have timelines with structural sections. Scenes have layers with gain, muting, and section roles. Automation lanes have curves with interpolation. The data model is dense because the product does real musical work.

If you just need to tag and categorize audio files, a spreadsheet or asset manager is the right tool. Soundweave expects you to compose, not just catalog.

## Not a Toy Sequencer

The clip editor, cue structure, scale/chord tools, motif transforms, intensity derivation, and automation system exist to produce professional-quality results. Soundweave models real musical concepts: scales (major, minor, pentatonic, and more), chord voicings, motif transforms (transpose, invert, arpeggiate, octave shift), intensity variants for adaptive layering, and section envelopes for structural dynamics.

This is a composition workstation with a deep musical vocabulary, not a grid of colored blocks that beep.

## Not a World Database with Music Attached

Soundweave has world scoring features -- motif families, score profiles, cue families, score map entries -- but it is not a game design tool or world-building database. The world scoring layer exists exclusively to give musical decisions a coherent relationship to game geography, factions, and encounters. Music first, world context second.

The score map context types are deliberately narrow: `region`, `faction`, `biome`, `encounter`, and `safe-zone`. Soundweave does not model quest trees, NPC dialogue, or level geometry. It models the sonic identity of those things.

## Not an AI Autopilot Music Vending Machine

Soundweave does not generate music for you. Every note, every transition, every layer, every automation curve is authored by the creator. Future composition assistance (Phase 24+) will suggest, not decide. The creator is always in control. AI is a tool, not a replacement for authorship.

## Not a Runtime Audio Engine

Soundweave is an authoring tool. It exports runtime packs -- stripped-down JSON bundles that a game engine consumes. Soundweave does not run inside your game at runtime. Your game engine loads the exported pack and handles playback, trigger evaluation, and transitions. The runtime contract is deliberately simple so that any engine can implement it.

## Not Middleware

Existing game audio middleware (FMOD, Wwise) focuses on playback routing, bank management, and platform-specific audio APIs. Soundweave starts from composition and arrangement, then exports a structured pack. It complements middleware rather than replacing it -- you can author in Soundweave and route playback through middleware if your project requires it.
